# MLKitTranslateCodelab
ML Kit Translate Codelab is a very simple codelan which enable us, the developer to built an app using the ML Kit Text Recognition on-device API to recognize text from real-time camera feed. Application uses ML Kit Language Identification API to identify language of the recognized text. Lastly, our app will translate this text to any chosen language out of 59 options, using the ML Kit Translation API.

I have successfully completed the [code lab ](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/mlkit-android-translate#0)

>Congratulations, you have just added on-device text recognition, language identification, and translation to your app using ML Kit! Now you can recognize text and its language from the live camera feed and translate this text to a language you choose all in real-time.
